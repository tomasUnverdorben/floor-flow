## üí° Why FloorFlow?

Modern offices are hybrid ‚Äî desks are shared, not owned.  
**FloorFlow** helps visualize your office layout and lets teammates reserve desks in just a few clicks.

It‚Äôs lightweight, open-source, and easy to self-host.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React ‚Ä¢ Vite ‚Ä¢ TypeScript  
**Backend:** Node.js ‚Ä¢ Express ‚Ä¢ JSON Store  
**Deployment:** Docker ‚Ä¢ Helm ‚Ä¢ Kubernetes  
**Optional:** Persistent volume storage or ephemeral mode

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# install server dependencies
npm install

# install client dependencies
npm install --prefix client

# start API server (port 4000)
npm run dev

# start API server with mongodb
1. change MONGODB_ENABLED env value in package.json to "true" 
2. docker compose up
3. npm run dev

# in another terminal, start the React app (port 5173)
npm run client
```

Access at **http://localhost:5173** (proxy ‚Üî `http://localhost:4000/api`).

---

## üèóÔ∏è Production Build

```bash
# build frontend
npm run build

# serve both API and built frontend
npm start
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `server/index.js` | Express API with JSON-backed reservation store |
| `server/data/seats.json` | Seat definitions (coordinates, metadata) |
| `server/data/bookings.json` | Active bookings (auto-created) |
| `server/data/cancellations.json` | Cancellation log used for analytics |
| `client/src/App.tsx` | React app with interactive map & sidebar |
| `client/public/floorplan.png` | Default image for floor 1 (used until replaced per floor) |

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Editing the Floor Plan & Seats

1. Replace `client/public/floorplan.png` with your real layout (~1600√ó900 recommended) for the ground floor.
2. Start the app and toggle **Edit mode** in the top-right corner.
3. Use the floor selector to pick the level you want to edit. In the toolbar you can:
   - set the total number of floors,
   - upload or remove a floor plan image for the active floor,
   - **draw a new seat area** by clicking the *Draw seat area* button and dragging a rectangle on the map,
   - **resize seats directly on the plan** by grabbing the corner handles,
   - drag and reposition seats,
   - add or remove seats,
   - update labels, zones, notes, floor assignment, width, height, and rotation,
   - fine-tune zoom and marker size.
4. Changes save automatically to `server/data/seats.json` (seat coordinates/floor) and the floor-plan storage (filesystem or MongoDB).

Alternatively, edit the JSON directly:
```json
{
  "id": "35-4",
  "label": "35-4",
  "x": 47.2,
  "y": 63.5,
  "width": 7.5,
  "height": 5.2,
  "rotation": 0,
  "floor": 1,
  "zone": "North",
  "notes": "Near window"
}
```

Each seat stores its position as percentages of the floor-plan image, along with the rectangle size (`width`/`height`) and a clockwise rotation in degrees.

---

## üõó Multi-floor Buildings

- Floor plans, seat coordinates, and bookings are now floor-aware. Use the selector above the map to jump between levels.
- In edit mode you can change the total number of floors and upload a dedicated image for each one. Images are stored on the persistent volume by default or inside MongoDB when `MONGODB_ENABLED=true`.
- Seat forms let you assign or move desks between floors. Reducing the floor count automatically clamps existing seats and removes unused floor-plan images.

## üì° API Overview

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/building` | Building configuration (floor count, names, map status) |
| PUT | `/api/building` | Update total floors / names *(admin)* |
| GET | `/api/floorplans/:floor` | Floor-plan metadata for a floor |
| PUT | `/api/floorplans/:floor` | Upload or replace the floor-plan image *(admin)* |
| DELETE | `/api/floorplans/:floor` | Remove the floor-plan image *(admin)* |
| GET | `/api/seats` | Get all seats |
| POST | `/api/seats` | Create new seat (set `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `rotation`, `floor`) |
| PUT | `/api/seats/:seatId` | Update existing seat |
| DELETE | `/api/seats/:seatId` | Remove a seat (if unbooked) |
| GET | `/api/bookings?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | Get bookings for a date |
| POST | `/api/bookings` | Create booking `{ seatId, date, userName, recurrence?, skipConflicts? }` |
| POST | `/api/bookings/preview` | Preview availability |
| DELETE | `/api/bookings/:bookingId` | Cancel a single booking |
| DELETE | `/api/bookings/series/:seriesId` | Cancel a recurring series |
| GET | `/api/analytics/summary?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD` | Aggregate booking and cancellation stats |

### üîÅ Recurring Bookings

- Supported via UI or API (`daily` or `weekly`, up to 52 occurrences)
- Default: **all-or-nothing**
- `skipConflicts: true` ‚Üí only free dates are created
- Each booking returns a `seriesId` for easy cancellation

---

## üë• Managing Reservations

- The sidebar shows everyone with bookings for the selected day and, in a separate panel, a full list of users with reservations.
- The ‚ÄúBookings on this day‚Äù list is fully interactive ‚Äî click a row to jump to that seat on the floor plan and highlight it instantly.
- Click a user chip to expand an interactive list of their upcoming bookings ‚Äî move a single day to another seat or cancel it in one click.
- Need a desk fast? When no seat is selected, the details panel now suggests up to five free seats for the chosen day (prioritising the current floor), and picking one auto-selects it on the map.
- The cancellation actions are synced with the server and feed into analytics automatically.

---

## üìä Analytics Dashboard

Need a bigger picture? Click the **Statistics** button next to *Edit mode*.

- Filter by custom start/end dates or use quick ranges (7 / 30 / 90 days, year-to-date).
- See totals for created, active, and cancelled bookings plus the average per day and the number of unique teammates reserving seats.
- Ranked tables highlight the most popular seats, most active users, teammates who cancel most often, and the busiest days in the selected window ‚Äî each list now includes inline bar charts so you can see relative volumes at a glance.

All metrics are powered by `/api/analytics/summary`, which computes aggregates from the JSON data store. Attach the API to BI tooling or export the results if you need deeper reporting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Tips

Custom backend URL (for proxy setups):
```bash
# client/.env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://your-api:4000
```

---

## üê≥ Docker

```bash
# build image
docker build -t floorflow:latest .

# run locally with persistent data
docker run -p 4000:4000   -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data   floorflow:latest
```

---

## ‚éà Helm Chart

A simple Helm chart is available in `chart/floorflow`:

```bash
helm install floorflow ./chart/floorflow   --set image.repository=<your-registry>/floorflow   --set image.tag=latest
```

Disable persistent storage if you prefer ephemeral data:
```bash
helm install floorflow ./chart/floorflow --set persistence.enabled=false
```

> The chart includes a `seats-data` ConfigMap preloading `seats.json`.  
> Edit it and redeploy via `helm upgrade`.

---

### üîí Edit Mode Password

Protect the seat editor with an environment variable:

**Docker**
```bash
docker run -e ADMIN_PASSWORD="super-secret" ...
```

**Helm**
```bash
kubectl create secret generic floorflow-admin   --from-literal=password="super-secret"

helm upgrade --install floorflow ./chart/floorflow   --set admin.existingSecret=floorflow-admin
```

Without a password, edit mode is open to all users.

---

## üí° Future Ideas

- Authentication & roles (admin / user)
- Calendar sync (Outlook, Google)
- CSV/Excel seat import & version history
